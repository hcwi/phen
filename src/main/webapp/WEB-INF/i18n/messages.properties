welcome_text=We present a set of algorithms to analyse phenotyping experiments, provided in <a href="http://isatab.sourceforge.net/format.html"> ISA-TAB \
format </a> and its <a href="http://cropnet.pl/phenotypes/?page_id=37"> extension for phenotyping </a> 

instruction_header=How to use 
instruction_text=In the left side menu click 'Upload ISArchive'. Fill in the form by typing your data and pointing to your ISArchive containing \
a zipped ISA-TAB-formatted experiment with a phenotyping assay, prepared according to the <a href="http://cropnet.pl/phenotypes/?page_id=71"> phenotyping configuration</a>. \
Your files will appear on the list of datasets, available through 'List all Analyses' option. There, you can choose three types of analyses:\
<ul><li>Time Series Analysis -  non-parameteric approach to the analysis and reduction of time-dependent observations, through application of FDA methods. </li>\
<li>Sufficient Statistics - algebraic compression of a set of observations to sufficient statistics. They seize all important information for further analysis and \
 storage, and thus allow to reduce the size of the original data set by dropping the raw observations</li>\
<li>Estimation of Effects - linear mixed model of factorial phenotyping experiments, provides estimates for variable factors. </li></ul> \
<p><b>Results</b></p>\
Upon completion of the analysis, the status will change to 'DONE', and the results will be available for download as ISA-TAB archive. Your dataset will be enriched \
by the result files (one per analysis), and your Investigation and Assay files will be updated by a reference to the result files, and a protocol describing the corresponding \
procedure. \
In case of analysis failure, check the status message for the corresponding analysis in the view of your dataset. Generally, failures usually result from incorrect format \
(general ISA-TAB errors, wrong configuration), lack of annotations (no information about fixed and random effects in the model), or specific experiment design, \
unsuitable for particular type of analysis.\
<p><b>What comes next</b></p>\
You can store your dataset (especially a reduced one) in a dedicated phenotyping database - check \
<a href="http://www.igr.poznan.pl/bb/bii/">BII-transPLANT</a> and <a href="http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/ephesis">Ephesis</a>.
